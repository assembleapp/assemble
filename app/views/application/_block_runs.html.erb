      This block has not been run yet.

      <p>
      You can run it by passing in input from another block.
      For example, to trigger it from Javascript try:
      </p>

      <pre><code>block.trigger("<%= "#{block.user.username}/#{block.name}"%>", { "data": "goes here" })</code></pre>

      <p>
      You can also set up this block to run in response to online actions.
      <%= link_to "Look through our collection of triggers", triggers_path %>,
      and then <%= link_to "edit this block", edit_block_path(block.user, block) %>
      to subscribe to a trigger.
      </p>

  <% end %>
